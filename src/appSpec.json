Imagine a cyberpunk cityscape bathed in neon, where the college fest is the hottest event. This isn't just a website; it's a digital rave.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Broken Grid, Intentional Overlap: A 12-column grid provides a base, but elements will intentionally break free, overlapping to create depth and visual chaos.\n2. Typography as Raw Power: Headlines are massive, bold, and unapologetic, acting as graphic elements. Paragraphs are clean and functional for readability.\n3. Neon Accents on Dark Matter: A dark background is punctuated by vibrant neon accents and gradients, creating a high-contrast, electric feel.\n4. Snappy Micro-Interactions: Fast, responsive animations and micro-interactions enhance the user experience without being distracting.",

The 'background' color serves as the canvas for standard content, research data, and card-based layouts, paired with the 'foreground' color for text. The 'primary' color is the brand's 'safety signal'; use it exclusively for high-impact visual anchors such as numbered badges, active navigation states, or primary call-to-action buttons. Do not overuse the 'primary' color for large backgrounds. Use 'surfaceDark' for container elements that sit on top of the 'secondary' background to create subtle depth. The 'divider' color should be used for the thin, precise horizontal lines that structure the content.",

Similarly, 'secondary' and 'secondaryForeground' offer high contrast suitable for all text sizes. The 'primary' color with 'primaryForeground' generally meets minimum contrast requirements for large text or graphical UI components (like the numbered badges shown) but may fall short of WCAG AA for small body text; therefore, avoid using 'primary' as a background for fine print.

Text should primarily use the 'foreground' color (white) for body copy to ensure maximum readability, while the 'primary' color can be used for large, short headings or emphasis. The 'secondary' color (dark grey) can be used for subtle surface differentiation, such as card backgrounds or footers, paired with 'secondaryForeground' text. Avoid using the 'primary' color for long blocks of text to prevent eye strain. The 'destructive' color is reserved strictly for error states or dangerous actions",

The combination of the 'primary' orange and 'background' black yields a contrast ratio of approximately 10.5:1, well exceeding WCAG AA and AAA requirements for both large and normal text. The 'foreground' white on 'background' black offers the highest possible contrast (21:1). Ensure that any text placed on top of the 'primary' color uses 'primaryForeground' (black) rather than white, as white on orange may not meet contrast standards. The 'secondary' and 'secondaryForeground' pairing also maintains high visibility."
